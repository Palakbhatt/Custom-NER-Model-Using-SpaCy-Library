      "In this backdrop, this Court examined the provisions of Section 301. Section 301 is\n",
      "extracted below:\n",

      "Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear and plead without any written\n",

      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",
      "evidence is closed in the case.”\n",
      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",
      "party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the\n",
      "position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the\n",
      "prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in\n",
      "the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to\n",
      "his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or\n",
      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",
      "envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused\n",
      "and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not\n",
      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",
      "having been brought to its knowledge should have examined the scope for invoking\n",
      "Section 311 and set right the position. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, the trial\n",

      "In this backdrop, this Court examined the provisions of Section 301. Section 301 is\n",
      "extracted below:\n",
      "“301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant\n",
      "Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear and plead without any written\n",
      "authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal.\n",

      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",
      "evidence is closed in the case.”\n",
      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",
      "party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the\n",
      "position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the\n",
      "prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in\n",
      "the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to\n",
      "his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or\n",
      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",
      "envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused\n",
      "and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not\n",
      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",
      "having been brought to its knowledge should have examined the scope for invoking\n",

      "with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",

      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",

      "In this backdrop, this Court examined the provisions of Section 301. Section 301 is\n",
      "extracted below:\n",
      "“301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant\n",
      "Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear and plead without any written\n",
      "authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal.\n",

      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",
      "evidence is closed in the case.”\n",
      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",
      "party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the\n",
      "position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the\n",
      "prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in\n",
      "the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to\n",
      "his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or\n",
      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",
      "envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused\n",
      "and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not\n",
      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",
      "having been brought to its knowledge should have examined the scope for invoking\n",
      "Section 311 and set right the position. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, the trial\n",

      "contained in Section 301 does not stand in the way.\n",
      "28 Having clarified that the bar under Section 301 is inapplicable and that the\n",
      "appellant is well placed to pursue this appeal, we now examine Section 311 of\n",
      "CrPC. Section 311 provides that the Court “may”:\n",

      "though not summoned as a witness; and\n",
      "(ii) Recall and re-examine any person who has already been examined.\n",
      "This power can be exercised at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding\n",
      "under the CrPC. The latter part of Section 311 states that the Court “shall”\n",
      "summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person “if his evidence\n",
      "appears to the Court to be essential to the just decision of the case”. Section 311\n",
      "contains a power upon the Court in broad terms. The statutory provision must be\n",
      "read purposively, to achieve the intent of the statute to aid in the discovery of\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "29 The first part of the statutory provision which uses the expression “may”\n",
      "postulates that the power can be exercised at any stage of an inquiry, trial or other\n",
      "proceeding. The latter part of the provision mandates the recall of a witness by the\n",
      "Court as it uses the expression “shall summon and examine or recall and re-\n",
      "examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just\n",
      "decision of the case”. Essentiality of the evidence of the person who is to be\n",
      "examined coupled with the need for the just decision of the case constitute the\n",
      "touchstone which must guide the decision of the Court. The first part of the\n",
      "statutory provision is discretionary while the latter part is obligatory.\n",
      "30 A two judge Bench of this Court in Mohanlal Shamji Soni (supra) while dealing\n",
      "with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",
      "an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only\n",
      "condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to\n",
      "the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the\n",
      "desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power\n",
      "under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle\n",
      "underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in\n",
      "order to meet the requirements of justice.”\n",
      "Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the\n",
      "power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either\n",
      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",
      "appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by\n",
      "all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:\n",
      "“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be\n",
      "invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof\n",
      "of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not\n",
      "capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power\n",
      "may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be\n",
      "taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not\n",
      "be used for filling up the lacuna left by the prosecution or by the defence or to the\n",
      "disadvantage of the accused or to cause serious prejudice to the defence of the\n",
      "accused or to give an unfair advantage to the rival side and further the additional\n",
      "evidence should not be received as a disguise for a retrial or to change the nature\n",
      "of the case against either of the parties.”\n",
      "31 Summing up the position as it obtained from various decisions of this Court,\n",
      "namely Rameshwar Dayal v. State of U.P. (1978) 2 SCC 5189, State of W.B. v.\n",

      "of Maharashtra (1971) 1 SCC 523, the Court held:\n",
      "“27. The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in\n",
      "the above decisions is that the criminal court has ample power to summon any\n",
      "person as a witness or recall and re-examine any such person even if the evidence\n",
      "on both sides is closed and the jurisdiction of the court must obviously be dictated\n",
      "by exigency of the situation, and fair play and good sense appear to be the only\n",
      "safe guides and that only the requirements of justice command the examination of\n",
      "any person which would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.”\n",
      "32 The power of the court is not constrained by the closure of evidence. Therefore,\n",
      "it is amply clear from the above discussion that the broad powers under Section\n",
      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",
      "exercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is essential for the just\n",
      "decision of the case. The statutory provision goes to emphasise that the court is\n",
      "not a hapless bystander in the derailment of justice. Quite to the contrary, the\n",
      "court has a vital role to discharge in ensuring that the cause of discovering truth as\n",

      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",

      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",

      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",

      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",

      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",

      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",

      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",
      "exercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is essential for the just\n",
      "decision of the case. The statutory provision goes to emphasise that the court is\n",
      "not a hapless bystander in the derailment of justice. Quite to the contrary, the\n",
      "court has a vital role to discharge in ensuring that the cause of discovering truth as\n",
      "an aid in the realization of justice is manifest.\n",

      "In this backdrop, this Court examined the provisions of Section 301. Section 301 is\n",
      "extracted below:\n",
      "“301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant\n",
      "Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear and plead without any written\n",
      "authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal.\n",

      "therein under the directions of the Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor,\n",
      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",
      "evidence is closed in the case.”\n",
      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",
      "party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the\n",
      "position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the\n",
      "prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in\n",
      "the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to\n",
      "his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or\n",
      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",
      "envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused\n",
      "and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not\n",
      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",
      "having been brought to its knowledge should have examined the scope for invoking\n",
      "Section 311 and set right the position. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, the trial\n",

      "the Public Prosecutor for putting across the appropriate question or court question\n",

      "26 The objection which has been raised by the second, third and sixth respondents\n",
      "on the basis of the provisions of Section 301 CrPC lacks substance. Sub-section (1)\n",

      "production of the decoding register was submitted by the State. Hence, the bar\n",
      "contained in Section 301 does not stand in the way.\n",
      "28 Having clarified that the bar under Section 301 is inapplicable and that the\n",
      "appellant is well placed to pursue this appeal, we now examine Section 311 of\n",
      "CrPC. Section 311 provides that the Court “may”:\n",

      "summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person “if his evidence\n",
      "appears to the Court to be essential to the just decision of the case”. Section 311\n",

      "examined coupled with the need for the just decision of the case constitute the\n",
      "touchstone which must guide the decision of the Court. The first part of the\n",
      "statutory provision is discretionary while the latter part is obligatory.\n",
      "30 A two judge Bench of this Court in Mohanlal Shamji Soni (supra) while dealing\n",
      "with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",
      "an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only\n",
      "condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to\n",
      "the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the\n",
      "desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power\n",
      "under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle\n",
      "underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in\n",
      "order to meet the requirements of justice.”\n",
      "Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the\n",
      "power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either\n",
      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",
      "appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by\n",
      "all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:\n",
      "“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be\n",
      "invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof\n",
      "of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not\n",
      "capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power\n",
      "may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be\n",
      "taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not\n",

      "of Maharashtra (1971) 1 SCC 523, the Court held:\n",
      "“27. The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in\n",

      "person as a witness or recall and re-examine any such person even if the evidence\n",
      "on both sides is closed and the jurisdiction of the court must obviously be dictated\n",

      "it is amply clear from the above discussion that the broad powers under Section\n",
      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",

      "In this backdrop, this Court examined the provisions of Section 301. Section 301 is\n",
      "extracted below:\n",
      "“301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant\n",
      "Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear and plead without any written\n",
      "authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal.\n",

      "and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the\n",
      "evidence is closed in the case.”\n",
      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",
      "party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the\n",
      "position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the\n",
      "prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in\n",
      "the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to\n",
      "his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or\n",
      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",
      "envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused\n",
      "and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not\n",
      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",
      "having been brought to its knowledge should have examined the scope for invoking\n",
      "Section 311 and set right the position. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, the trial\n",

      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",
      "an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only\n",
      "condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to\n",
      "the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the\n",
      "desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power\n",
      "under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle\n",
      "underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in\n",
      "order to meet the requirements of justice.”\n",
      "Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the\n",
      "power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either\n",
      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",
      "appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by\n",
      "all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:\n",
      "“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be\n",
      "invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof\n",
      "of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not\n",
      "capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power\n",
      "may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be\n",
      "taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not\n",
      "be used for filling up the lacuna left by the prosecution or by the defence or to the\n",
      "disadvantage of the accused or to cause serious prejudice to the defence of the\n",
      "accused or to give an unfair advantage to the rival side and further the additional\n",

      "“27. The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in\n",

      "person as a witness or recall and re-examine any such person even if the evidence\n",

      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",
      "exercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is essential for the just\n",
      "decision of the case. The statutory provision goes to emphasise that the court is\n",
      "not a hapless bystander in the derailment of justice. Quite to the contrary, the\n",
      "court has a vital role to discharge in ensuring that the cause of discovering truth as\n",
      "an aid in the realization of justice is manifest.\n",

      "“28. The court is not empowered under the provisions of the Code to compel either\n",
      "the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on\n",
      "their side. This must be left to the parties. But in weighing the evidence, the court\n",
      "can take note of the fact that the best available evidence has not been given, and\n",
      "can draw an adverse inference. The court will often have to depend on intercepted\n",
      "allegations made by the parties, or on inconclusive inference from facts elicited in\n",
      "the evidence. In such cases, the court has to act under the second part of the\n",
      "section. Sometimes the examination of witnesses as directed by the court\n",
      "may result in what is thought to be “filling of loopholes”. That is purely a\n",
      "subsidiary factor and cannot be taken into account. Whether the new\n",
      "evidence is essential or not must of course depend on the facts of each case, and\n",

      "(supra), the Court observed that it is the duty of the criminal court to allow the\n",
      "prosecution to correct an error in interest of justice. In Rajendra Prasad (supra),\n",
      "the Court had held that:\n",
      "“8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood as the inherent weakness or a\n",
      "latent wedge in the matrix of the prosecution case. The advantage of it should\n",
      "normally go to the accused in the trial of the case, but an oversight in the\n",

      "in a trial can be foreclosed from correcting errors. If proper evidence was\n",
      "not adduced or a relevant material was not brought on record due to any\n",
      "inadvertence, the court should be magnanimous in permitting such\n",
      "mistakes to be rectified. After all, function of the criminal court is administration\n",

      "the decoding registers fits into the requirement of being relevant material which\n",
      "was not brought on record due to inadvertence.\n",
      "41 Finally, we also briefly deal with the objection of the respondents regarding the\n",
      "stage at which the application under Section 311 was filed. The respondents have\n",
      "placed reliance on Swapan Kumar (supra), a two judge Bench decision of this\n",
      "Court, to argue that the application should not be allowed as it has been made at a\n",
      "belated stage. The Court in Swapan Kumar (supra) observed:\n",
      "“11. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section 311 should be\n",
      "invoked by the court only to meet the ends of justice. The power is to be exercised\n",
      "only for strong and valid reasons and it should be exercised with great caution and\n",
      "circumspection. The court has wide power under this Section to even recall\n",
      "witnesses for re-examination or further examination, necessary in the interest of\n",
      "justice, but the same has to be exercised after taking into consideration the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall not be\n",
      "exercised if the court is of the view that the application has been filed as an abuse\n",
      "of the process of law.\n",
      "12. Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for\n",
      "non-examination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the\n",
      "witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not\n",
      "be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive\n",
      "applications for recall of a witness under this provision.”\n",
      "In the present appeal, the argument that the application was filed after the closure\n",
      "of the evidence of the prosecution is manifestly erroneous. As already noted\n",
      "above, the closure of the evidence of the prosecution took place after the\n",
      "application for the production of the decoding register and for summoning of the\n",
      "witness under Section 311 was dismissed. Though the dismissal of the application\n",
      "and the closure of the prosecution evidence both took place on 13 November 2021,\n",
      "the application by the prosecution had been filed on 15 March 2021 nearly eight\n",
      "months earlier. As a matter of fact, another witness for the prosecution, Rajesh\n",

      "with a prayer for examination of witnesses under Section 311 CrPC explained the\n",
      "role of the court, in the following terms:\n",
      "“43. The courts have to take a participatory role in a trial. They are not expected\n",
      "to be tape recorders to record whatever is being stated by the witnesses. Section\n",
      "311 of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act confer vast and wide powers\n",
      "on presiding officers of court to elicit all necessary materials by playing an active\n",
      "role in the evidence-collecting process. They have to monitor the proceedings\n",
      "in aid of justice in a manner that something, which is not relevant, is not\n",
      "unnecessarily brought into record. Even if the prosecutor is remiss in\n",

      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",
      "responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or\n",
      "inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous\n",
      "statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any\n",

      "later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained\n",
      "silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify\n",
      "the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n",

      "punished. It is with the above background, we feel that the present issue involved\n",
      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "24 The Court noted that while it is true that Section 301 places limitations on the\n",
      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",
      "just decision. The court held in that context:\n",
      "“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a\n",
      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",
      "have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just\n",
      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",

      "appellant is well placed to pursue this appeal, we now examine Section 311 of\n",

      "summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person “if his evidence\n",

      "examined coupled with the need for the just decision of the case constitute the\n",
      "touchstone which must guide the decision of the Court. The first part of the\n",
      "statutory provision is discretionary while the latter part is obligatory.\n",
      "30 A two judge Bench of this Court in Mohanlal Shamji Soni (supra) while dealing\n",
      "with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",
      "an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only\n",
      "condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to\n",
      "the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the\n",
      "desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power\n",
      "under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle\n",
      "underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in\n",
      "order to meet the requirements of justice.”\n",
      "Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the\n",
      "power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either\n",
      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",
      "appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by\n",
      "all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:\n",
      "“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be\n",
      "invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof\n",
      "of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not\n",
      "capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power\n",
      "may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be\n",
      "taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not\n",

      "it is amply clear from the above discussion that the broad powers under Section\n",
      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",
      "exercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is essential for the just\n",

      "the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on\n",
      "their side. This must be left to the parties. But in weighing the evidence, the court\n",

      "allegations made by the parties, or on inconclusive inference from facts elicited in\n",
      "the evidence. In such cases, the court has to act under the second part of the\n",

      "may result in what is thought to be “filling of loopholes”. That is purely a\n",
      "subsidiary factor and cannot be taken into account. Whether the new\n",

      "prosecution to correct an error in interest of justice. In Rajendra Prasad (supra),\n",
      "the Court had held that:\n",
      "“8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood as the inherent weakness or a\n",

      "41 Finally, we also briefly deal with the objection of the respondents regarding the\n",
      "stage at which the application under Section 311 was filed. The respondents have\n",
      "placed reliance on Swapan Kumar (supra), a two judge Bench decision of this\n",
      "Court, to argue that the application should not be allowed as it has been made at a\n",
      "belated stage. The Court in Swapan Kumar (supra) observed:\n",
      "“11. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section 311 should be\n",
      "invoked by the court only to meet the ends of justice. The power is to be exercised\n",
      "only for strong and valid reasons and it should be exercised with great caution and\n",
      "circumspection. The court has wide power under this Section to even recall\n",
      "witnesses for re-examination or further examination, necessary in the interest of\n",
      "justice, but the same has to be exercised after taking into consideration the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall not be\n",
      "exercised if the court is of the view that the application has been filed as an abuse\n",
      "of the process of law.\n",
      "12. Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for\n",
      "non-examination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the\n",
      "witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not\n",
      "be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive\n",
      "applications for recall of a witness under this provision.”\n",
      "In the present appeal, the argument that the application was filed after the closure\n",
      "of the evidence of the prosecution is manifestly erroneous. As already noted\n",
      "above, the closure of the evidence of the prosecution took place after the\n",
      "application for the production of the decoding register and for summoning of the\n",
      "witness under Section 311 was dismissed. Though the dismissal of the application\n",
      "and the closure of the prosecution evidence both took place on 13 November 2021,\n",
      "the application by the prosecution had been filed on 15 March 2021 nearly eight\n",
      "months earlier. As a matter of fact, another witness for the prosecution, Rajesh\n",

      "with a prayer for examination of witnesses under Section 311 CrPC explained the\n",
      "role of the court, in the following terms:\n",
      "“43. The courts have to take a participatory role in a trial. They are not expected\n",
      "to be tape recorders to record whatever is being stated by the witnesses. Section\n",
      "311 of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act confer vast and wide powers\n",
      "on presiding officers of court to elicit all necessary materials by playing an active\n",
      "role in the evidence-collecting process. They have to monitor the proceedings\n",
      "in aid of justice in a manner that something, which is not relevant, is not\n",
      "unnecessarily brought into record. Even if the prosecutor is remiss in\n",
      "some ways, it can control the proceedings effectively so that the ultimate\n",
      "objective i.e. truth is arrived at. This becomes more necessary where the\n",
      "court has reasons to believe that the prosecuting agency or the\n",
      "prosecutor is not acting in the requisite manner. The court cannot afford\n",
      "to be wishfully or pretend to be blissfully ignorant or oblivious to such\n",
      "serious pitfalls or dereliction of duty on the part of the prosecuting\n",
      "agency. The prosecutor who does not act fairly and acts more like a counsel for\n",
      "the defence is a liability to the fair judicial system, and courts could not also play\n",
      "into the hands of such prosecuting agency showing indifference or adopting an\n",
      "attitude of total aloofness.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Further, in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) (supra), the Court reiterated the extent of\n",
      "powers under Section 311 and held that:\n",
      "“27. The object underlying Section 311 of the Code is that there may not be failure\n",
      "of justice on account of mistake of either party in bringing the valuable evidence on\n",
      "record or leaving ambiguity in the statements of the witnesses examined from\n",
      "either side. The determinative factor is whether it is essential to the just\n",
      "decision of the case. The section is not limited only for the benefit of the\n",
      "accused, and it will not be an improper exercise of the powers of the court to\n",
      "summon a witness under the section merely because the evidence supports the\n",
      "case of the prosecution and not that of the accused. The section is a general section\n",
      "which applies to all proceedings, enquiries and trials under the Code and empowers\n",
      "the Magistrate to issue summons to any witness at any stage of such proceedings,\n",
      "trial or enquiry. In Section 311 the significant expression that occurs is “at\n",
      "any stage of any inquiry or trial or other proceeding under this Code”. It\n",
      "is, however, to be borne in mind that whereas the section confers a very wide\n",
      "power on the court on summoning witnesses, the discretion conferred is to be\n",
      "exercised judiciously, as the wider the power the greater is the necessity for\n",
      "application of judicial mind.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "43 The Court while reiterating the principle enunciated in Mohanlal Shamji Soni\n",
      "(supra) stressed upon the wide ambit of Section 311 which allows the power to be\n",
      "exercised at any stage and held that:\n",
      "“44. The power of the court under Section 165 of the Evidence Act is in a way\n",
      "complementary to its power under Section 311 of the Code. The section consists of\n",
      "two parts i.e.: (i) giving a discretion to the court to examine the witness at any\n",
      "stage, and (ii) the mandatory portion which compels the court to examine a\n",
      "witness if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the court.\n",
      "Though the discretion given to the court is very wide, the very width requires a\n",
      "corresponding caution. In Mohanlal v. Union of India this Court has observed, while\n",
      "considering the scope and ambit of Section 311, that the very usage of the words\n",
      "such as, “any court”, “at any stage”, or “any enquiry or trial or other proceedings”,\n",
      "“any person” and “any such person” clearly spells out that the section has\n",
      "expressed in the widest-possible terms and do not limit the discretion of the court\n",
      "in any way. However, as noted above, the very width requires a corresponding\n",
      "caution that the discretionary powers should be invoked as the exigencies of justice\n",
      "require and exercised judicially with circumspection and consistently with the\n",
      "provisions of the Code. The second part of the section does not allow any\n",
      "discretion but obligates and binds the court to take necessary steps if the\n",
      "fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case,\n",
      "“essential” to an active and alert mind and not to one which is bent to\n",
      "abandon or abdicate. Object of the section is to enable the court to arrive\n",
      "at the truth irrespective of the fact that the prosecution or the defence\n",
      "has failed to produce some evidence which is necessary for a just and proper\n",
      "disposal of the case. The power is exercised and the evidence is examined neither\n",

      "23 The Court observed:\n",
      "“19. In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the\n",
      "unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the\n",
      "State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the\n",
      "equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the\n",
      "course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in\n",
      "accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It\n",
      "can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its\n",

      "in the case on hand should be dealt with.”\n",

      "right of the private person to participate in criminal proceedings, nonetheless\n",
      "Section 311 empowers the trial court to summon witnesses in order to arrive at a\n",

      "situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should\n",

      "decision. In other words even if in the consideration of the trial Court invocation of\n",
      "Section 301(2) was not permissible, the anomalous evidence deposed by PW-18\n",

      "appellant is well placed to pursue this appeal, we now examine Section 311 of\n",

      "with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court\n",
      "an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only\n",
      "condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to\n",
      "the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the\n",
      "desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power\n",
      "under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle\n",
      "underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in\n",
      "order to meet the requirements of justice.”\n",
      "Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the\n",
      "power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either\n",
      "with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.\n",
      "It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should\n",
      "appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by\n",
      "all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:\n",
      "“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be\n",
      "invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof\n",
      "of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not\n",
      "capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power\n",
      "may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be\n",
      "taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not\n",

      "“27. The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in\n",

      "it is amply clear from the above discussion that the broad powers under Section\n",
      "311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be\n",

      "37 The relevance of the decoding register clearly emerges from the above\n",
      "statement of PW-41. Hence, the effort of the prosecution to produce the decoding\n",
      "register which is a crucial and vital piece of evidence ought not to have been\n",
      "obstructed. In terms of the provisions of Section 311, the summoning of the\n",

      "374, which was more recently reiterated in Godrej Pacific Tech. Ltd. v. Computer\n",
      "Joint India Ltd. (2008) 11 SCC 108, the Court specifically dealt with this objection\n",
      "and observed that the resultant filling of loopholes on account of allowing an\n",
      "application under Section 311 is merely a subsidiary factor and the Court‘s\n",
      "determination of the application should only be based on the test of the essentiality\n",
      "of the evidence. It noted that:\n",
      "“28. The court is not empowered under the provisions of the Code to compel either\n",
      "the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on\n",
      "their side. This must be left to the parties. But in weighing the evidence, the court\n",
      "can take note of the fact that the best available evidence has not been given, and\n",
      "can draw an adverse inference. The court will often have to depend on intercepted\n",
      "allegations made by the parties, or on inconclusive inference from facts elicited in\n",
      "the evidence. In such cases, the court has to act under the second part of the\n",
      "section. Sometimes the examination of witnesses as directed by the court\n",
      "may result in what is thought to be “filling of loopholes”. That is purely a\n",
      "subsidiary factor and cannot be taken into account. Whether the new\n",
      "evidence is essential or not must of course depend on the facts of each case, and\n",
      "has to be determined by the Presiding Judge.\n",

      "40 The right of the accused to a fair trial is constitutionally protected under Article\n",
      "21. However, in Mina Lalita Baruwa (supra), while reiterating Rajendra Prasad\n",
      "(supra), the Court observed that it is the duty of the criminal court to allow the\n",
      "prosecution to correct an error in interest of justice. In Rajendra Prasad (supra),\n",
      "the Court had held that:\n",
      "“8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood as the inherent weakness or a\n",
      "latent wedge in the matrix of the prosecution case. The advantage of it should\n",
      "normally go to the accused in the trial of the case, but an oversight in the\n",
      "management of the prosecution cannot be treated as irreparable lacuna. No party\n",
      "in a trial can be foreclosed from correcting errors. If proper evidence was\n",
      "not adduced or a relevant material was not brought on record due to any\n",
      "inadvertence, the court should be magnanimous in permitting such\n",
      "mistakes to be rectified. After all, function of the criminal court is administration\n",
      "of criminal justice and not to count errors committed by the parties or to find out\n",
      "and declare who among the parties performed better.”\n",

      "documents required to be able to appreciate the existing evidence in form of the\n",
      "call details which are already on record but use codes to signify the location of\n",
      "accused, a crucial detail, which can be decoded only through the decoding\n",

      "the decoding registers fits into the requirement of being relevant material which\n",
      "was not brought on record due to inadvertence.\n",
      "41 Finally, we also briefly deal with the objection of the respondents regarding the\n",
      "stage at which the application under Section 311 was filed. The respondents have\n",
      "placed reliance on Swapan Kumar (supra), a two judge Bench decision of this\n",
      "Court, to argue that the application should not be allowed as it has been made at a\n",
      "belated stage. The Court in Swapan Kumar (supra) observed:\n",
      "“11. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section 311 should be\n",
      "invoked by the court only to meet the ends of justice. The power is to be exercised\n",
      "only for strong and valid reasons and it should be exercised with great caution and\n",
      "circumspection. The court has wide power under this Section to even recall\n",
      "witnesses for re-examination or further examination, necessary in the interest of\n",
      "justice, but the same has to be exercised after taking into consideration the facts\n",
      "and circumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall not be\n",
      "exercised if the court is of the view that the application has been filed as an abuse\n",
      "of the process of law.\n",
      "12. Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for\n",
      "non-examination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the\n",
      "witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not\n",
      "be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive\n",
      "applications for recall of a witness under this provision.”\n",
      "In the present appeal, the argument that the application was filed after the closure\n",
      "of the evidence of the prosecution is manifestly erroneous. As already noted\n",
      "above, the closure of the evidence of the prosecution took place after the\n",
      "application for the production of the decoding register and for summoning of the\n",
      "witness under Section 311 was dismissed. Though the dismissal of the application\n",
      "and the closure of the prosecution evidence both took place on 13 November 2021,\n",
      "the application by the prosecution had been filed on 15 March 2021 nearly eight\n",
      "months earlier. As a matter of fact, another witness for the prosecution, Rajesh\n",
      "Kumar Singh, was also released after examination and cross-examination on the\n",
      "same day as recorded in the order dated 13 November 2021 of the trial court.\n",
      "42 The Court is vested with a broad and wholesome power, in terms of Section 311\n",
      "of the CrPC, to summon and examine or recall and re-examine any material\n",
      "witness at any stage and the closing of prosecution evidence is not an absolute bar.\n",

      "adducing additional evidence under Section 391 CrPC at the appellate stage, along\n",
      "with a prayer for examination of witnesses under Section 311 CrPC explained the\n",
      "role of the court, in the following terms:\n",
      "“43. The courts have to take a participatory role in a trial. They are not expected\n",
      "to be tape recorders to record whatever is being stated by the witnesses. Section\n",
      "311 of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act confer vast and wide powers\n",
      "on presiding officers of court to elicit all necessary materials by playing an active\n",
      "role in the evidence-collecting process. They have to monitor the proceedings\n",
      "in aid of justice in a manner that something, which is not relevant, is not\n",
      "unnecessarily brought into record. Even if the prosecutor is remiss in\n",
      "some ways, it can control the proceedings effectively so that the ultimate\n",
      "objective i.e. truth is arrived at. This becomes more necessary where the\n",
      "court has reasons to believe that the prosecuting agency or the\n",
      "prosecutor is not acting in the requisite manner. The court cannot afford\n",
      "to be wishfully or pretend to be blissfully ignorant or oblivious to such\n",
      "serious pitfalls or dereliction of duty on the part of the prosecuting\n",
      "agency. The prosecutor who does not act fairly and acts more like a counsel for\n",
      "the defence is a liability to the fair judicial system, and courts could not also play\n",
      "into the hands of such prosecuting agency showing indifference or adopting an\n",
      "attitude of total aloofness.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "Further, in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) (supra), the Court reiterated the extent of\n",
      "powers under Section 311 and held that:\n",
      "“27. The object underlying Section 311 of the Code is that there may not be failure\n",
      "of justice on account of mistake of either party in bringing the valuable evidence on\n",
      "record or leaving ambiguity in the statements of the witnesses examined from\n",
      "either side. The determinative factor is whether it is essential to the just\n",
      "decision of the case. The section is not limited only for the benefit of the\n",
      "accused, and it will not be an improper exercise of the powers of the court to\n",
      "summon a witness under the section merely because the evidence supports the\n",
      "case of the prosecution and not that of the accused. The section is a general section\n",
      "which applies to all proceedings, enquiries and trials under the Code and empowers\n",
      "the Magistrate to issue summons to any witness at any stage of such proceedings,\n",
      "trial or enquiry. In Section 311 the significant expression that occurs is “at\n",
      "any stage of any inquiry or trial or other proceeding under this Code”. It\n",
      "is, however, to be borne in mind that whereas the section confers a very wide\n",
      "power on the court on summoning witnesses, the discretion conferred is to be\n",
      "exercised judiciously, as the wider the power the greater is the necessity for\n",
      "application of judicial mind.”\n",
      "(emphasis supplied)\n",
      "43 The Court while reiterating the principle enunciated in Mohanlal Shamji Soni\n",
      "(supra) stressed upon the wide ambit of Section 311 which allows the power to be\n",
      "exercised at any stage and held that:\n",
      "“44. The power of the court under Section 165 of the Evidence Act is in a way\n",
      "complementary to its power under Section 311 of the Code. The section consists of\n",
      "two parts i.e.: (i) giving a discretion to the court to examine the witness at any\n",
      "stage, and (ii) the mandatory portion which compels the court to examine a\n",
      "witness if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the court.\n",
      "Though the discretion given to the court is very wide, the very width requires a\n",
      "corresponding caution. In Mohanlal v. Union of India this Court has observed, while\n",
      "considering the scope and ambit of Section 311, that the very usage of the words\n",
      "such as, “any court”, “at any stage”, or “any enquiry or trial or other proceedings”,\n",
      "“any person” and “any such person” clearly spells out that the section has\n",
      "expressed in the widest-possible terms and do not limit the discretion of the court\n",
      "in any way. However, as noted above, the very width requires a corresponding\n",
      "caution that the discretionary powers should be invoked as the exigencies of justice\n",
      "require and exercised judicially with circumspection and consistently with the\n",
      "provisions of the Code. The second part of the section does not allow any\n",
      "discretion but obligates and binds the court to take necessary steps if the\n",
      "fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case,\n",
      "“essential” to an active and alert mind and not to one which is bent to\n",
      "abandon or abdicate. Object of the section is to enable the court to arrive\n",
      "at the truth irrespective of the fact that the prosecution or the defence\n",
      "has failed to produce some evidence which is necessary for a just and proper\n",
      "disposal of the case. The power is exercised and the evidence is examined neither\n",
      "to help the prosecution nor the defence, if the court feels that there is necessity to\n",
      "act in terms of Section 311 but only to subserve the cause of justice and public\n",
      "interest. It is done with an object of getting the evidence in aid of a just decision\n",
      "and to uphold the truth.\n",

      "State of Bihar (1998) 4 SCC 517 and Amar Singh v. Balwinder Singh (2003) 2 SCC\n",
      "518 this Court held that the court may interfere even at the stage of appeal:\n",
      "“64. It is no doubt true that the accused persons have been acquitted by the trial\n",

      "on tainted evidence, tailored investigation, unprincipled prosecutor and perfunctory\n",

       ".</br>6 The statements of accused – Suresh (the fifth respondent) and Mangilal (the</br>fourth respondent) – under Section 313 CrPC were recorded on 25 January 2020</br>and 12 February 2020 respectively. During the course of the trial, the CD had been</br>produced but since it was found to be ‗corrupted‘, an application was made to the</br>trial court to requisition the copy of the CD which was available at the police</br>station. The application was allowed on 15 November 2019. On the subsequent</br>date, PW47 marked his appearance. On the next date of hearing, when PW47 was</br>required to produce the CD which was kept at the police station, he failed to do so.</br>In those circumstances, an application (“first application”) was preferred to</br>requisition the said CD but this application was rejected by the trial court on the</br>ground that the evidence of PW47 had been recorded and a last opportunity had</br>already been given to him to produce the CD. A Single Judge of the High Court on</br>2 March 2020 allowed the petition instituted by the appellant to challenge the order</br>of the trial court, noting that the CD was a vital piece of evidence and had been</br>provided to all the accused along with the charge-sheet. Resultantly, the trial court</br>was directed to take necessary steps for requisitioning the CD through the police</br>station and for taking it on record from PW47.</br>7 On 15 March 2021, another application (“second application”) was moved under</br>Section 311 on behalf of the prosecution for summoning the decoding register.</br>8 On 5 July 2021, the prosecution filed an application (“third application”) under</br>Section 311 CrPC stating that the court had taken on record the CD and a</br>certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act, in pursuance of the order of the</br>High Court admitting its previous application. By filing the third application, the</br>prosecution sought permission to summon the certificate issuer and examine said</br>witness in order to prove the certificate.</br>9 On 16 July 2021, an application was filed by the prosecution (“fourth application”)</br>under Section 311 to summon the nodal officer of Idea and under Section 91 to</br>produce the call data records of two mobile numbers.</br>10 On 22 September 2021, the trial court allowed the third application but</br>dismissed the fourth application. This order of the trial court was challenged before</br>the High Court.</br>11 In the meantime, the trial court by an order dated 13 November 2021</br>dismissed the second application as well. The trial court in its order dated 13</br>November 2021 rejected the application for the production of the decoding register</br>on the ground that:</br>(i) The document which the prosecution desired to summon does not form a part of</br>the investigation; and</br>(ii) The document has not been obtained during the course of the investigation.</br>Consequently, on the same date, the trial court also recorded that the evidence of</br>the prosecution stood closed. The appellant challenged this order of the trial court</br>before the High Court invoking its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC. While</br>rejecting this petition on 8 April 2022 in Misc. Criminal Case No. 57152 of 2021, the</br>Single Judge of the High Court held that</br>A. The decoding registers are not part of the case diary or the charge-sheet;</br>B.

PW 18 was a Sub Divisional Judicial</br>Magistrate before whom the Test Identification Parade [“TIP”] was held.

In criminal jurisprudence, while the offence is against the society, it is the</br>unfortunate victim who is the actual sufferer and therefore, it is imperative for the</br>State and the prosecution to ensure that no stone is left unturned. It is also the</br>equal, if not more, duty and responsibility of the court to be alive and alert in the</br>course of trial of a criminal case and ensure that the evidence recorded in</br>accordance with law reflect upon every bit of vital information placed before it. It</br>can also be said that in that process the court should be conscious of its</br>responsibility and at times when the prosecution either deliberately or</br>inadvertently omit to bring forth a notable piece of evidence or a conspicuous</br>statement of any witness with a view to either support or prejudice the case of any</br>party, should not hesitate to interject and prompt the prosecution side to clarify the</br>position or act on its own and get the record of proceedings straight. Neither the</br>prosecution nor the court should remain a silent spectator in such situations. Like in</br>the present case where there is a wrong statement made by a witness contrary to</br>his own record and the prosecution failed to note the situation at that moment or</br>later when it was brought to light and whereafter also the prosecution remained</br>silent, the court should have acted promptly and taken necessary steps to rectify</br>the situation appropriately. The whole scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure</br>envisages fool proof system in dealing with a crime alleged against the accused</br>and thereby ensure that the guilty does not escape and the innocent is not</br>punished.

The court held in that context:</br>“21 …Therefore, a reading of Sections 301 and 311 together keeping in mind a</br>situation like the one on hand, it will have to be stated that the trial Court should</br>have examined whether invocation of Section 311 was required to arrive at a just</br>decision.

Unfortunately, as stated earlier, the trial</br>Court was in a great hurry in rejecting the appellant‘s application without actually</br>relying on the wide powers conferred on it under Section 311 CrPC for recalling</br>PW-18 and ensuring in what other manner, the grievance expressed by the victim</br>of a serious crime could be remedied.

It has got a participatory</br>role to play and having been invested with enormous powers under Section 311</br>CrPC, as well as Section 165 of the Evidence Act, a trial court in a situation like the</br>present one where it was brought to the notice of the court that a flagrant</br>contradiction in the evidence of PW 18 who was a statutory authority and in whose</br>presence the test identification parade was held, who is also a Judicial Magistrate,</br>ought to have risen to the occasion in public interest and remedied the situation by</br>invoking Section 311 CrPC, by recalling the said witness with further direction to</br>the Public Prosecutor for putting across the appropriate question or court question</br>to the said witness and thereby set right the glaring error accordingly. It is</br>unfortunate to state that the trial court miserably failed to come alive to the</br>realities as to the nature of evidence that was being recorded and miserably failed</br>in its duty to note the serious flaw and error in the recording of evidence of PW</br>18.”</br>26 The objection which has been raised by the second, third and sixth respondents</br>on the basis of the provisions of Section 301 CrPC lacks substance. Sub-section (1)</br>of Section 301 stipulates that the Public Prosecutor or the Assistant Public</br>Prosecutor in charge of a case may appear without written authority before any</br>court in which the case is under inquiry, trial or appeal. Sub-section (2) of Section</br>301 postulates that if any such case, any private person instructs a pleader to</br>prosecute any person in any court, the Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public</br>Prosecutor in charge of the case shall conduct the prosecution, and the pleader so</br>instructed shall act under the directions of the Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public</br>Prosecutor, and may, with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments</br>after the evidence is closed in the case.</br>27 In the present case, the application for the summoning of witness and for</br>production of the decoding register was submitted by \n",

       "Court as it uses the expression “shall summon and examine or recall and re-</br>examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just</br>decision of the case”. Essentiality of the evidence of the person who is to be</br>examined coupled with the need for the just decision of the case constitute the</br>touchstone which must guide the decision of the Court. The first part of the</br>statutory provision is discretionary while the latter part is obligatory.</br>30 A two judge Bench of this Court in Mohanlal Shamji Soni (supra) while dealing</br>with pari materia provisions of Section 540 of the Criminal Code of Procedure 1898</br>observed:</br>“16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court</br>an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only</br>condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to</br>the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the</br>desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power</br>under this provision — either discretionary or mandatory — depending on the facts</br>and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle</br>underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in</br>order to meet the requirements of justice.”</br>Justice S Ratnavel Pandian, speaking for the two judge Bench, noted that the</br>power is couched in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either</br>with regard to the stage at which it can be exercised or the manner of its exercise.</br>It is only circumscribed by the principle that the “evidence to be obtained should</br>appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by</br>all lawful means.” In that context the Court observed:</br>“18 …Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be</br>invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof</br>of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not</br>capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power</br>may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be</br>taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not</br>be used for filling up the lacuna left by the prosecution or by the defence or to the</br>disadvantage of the accused or to cause serious prejudice to the defence of the</br>accused or to give an unfair advantage to the rival side and further the additional</br>evidence should not be received as a disguise for a retrial or to change the nature</br>of the case against either of the parties.”</br>31 Summing up the position as it obtained from various decisions of this Court,</br>namely Rameshwar Dayal v.

The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in</br>the above decisions is that the criminal court has ample power to summon any</br>person as a witness or recall and re-examine any such person even if the evidence</br>on both sides is closed and the jurisdiction of the court must obviously be dictated</br>by exigency of the situation, and fair play and good sense appear to be the only</br>safe guides and that only the requirements of justice command the examination of</br>any person which would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.”</br>32 The power of the court is not constrained by the closure of evidence. Therefore,</br>it is amply clear from the above discussion that the broad powers under Section</br>311 are to be governed by the requirement of justice. The power must be</br>exercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is essential for the just</br>decision of the case. The statutory provision goes to emphasise that the court is</br>not a hapless bystander in the derailment of justice. Quite to the contrary, the</br>court has a vital role to discharge in ensuring that the cause of discovering truth as</br>an aid in the realization of justice is manifest.</br>33 Section 91 CrPC empowers inter alia any Court to issue summons to a person in</br>whose possession or power a document or thing is believed to be, where it</br>considers the production of the said document or thing necessary or desirable for</br>the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the CrPC.</br>34 Section 91 forms part of Chapter VII of CrPC which is titled “Processes to</br>Compel the Production of Things”. Chapter XVI of the CrPC titled “Commencement</br>of Proceedings before Magistrates” includes Section 207 which provides for the</br>supply to the accused of a copy of the police report and other documents in any</br>case where the proceeding has been instituted on a police report.

       " specifically dealt with this objection</br>and observed that the resultant filling of loopholes on account of allowing an</br>application under Section 311 is merely a subsidiary factor and the Court‘s</br>determination of the application should only be based on the test of the essentiality</br>of the evidence. It noted that:</br>“28. The court is not empowered under the provisions of the Code to compel either</br>the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on</br>their side. This must be left to the parties. But in weighing the evidence, the court</br>can take note of the fact that the best available evidence has not been given, and</br>can draw an adverse inference. The court will often have to depend on intercepted</br>allegations made by the parties, or on inconclusive inference from facts elicited in</br>the evidence. In such cases, the court has to act under the second part of the</br>section. Sometimes the examination of witnesses as directed by the court</br>may result in what is thought to be “filling of loopholes”. That is purely a</br>subsidiary factor and cannot be taken into account. Whether the new</br>evidence is essential or not must of course depend on the facts of each case, and</br>has to be determined by the Presiding Judge.</br>(emphasis supplied)</br>40 The right of the accused to a fair trial is constitutionally protected under Article</br>21. However, in Mina Lalita Baruwa (supra), while reiterating Rajendra Prasad</br>(supra), \n",

       " observed that it is the duty of the criminal court to allow the</br>prosecution to correct an error in interest of justice. In Rajendra Prasad (supra),</br>the Court had held that:</br>“8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood as the inherent weakness or a</br>latent wedge in the matrix of the prosecution case. The advantage of it should</br>normally go to the accused in the trial of the case, but an oversight in the</br>management of the prosecution cannot be treated as irreparable lacuna. No party</br>in a trial can be foreclosed from correcting errors. If proper evidence was</br>not adduced or a relevant material was not brought on record due to any</br>inadvertence, the court should be magnanimous in permitting such</br>mistakes to be rectified. After all, function of the criminal court is administration</br>of criminal justice and not to count errors committed by the parties or to find out</br>and declare who among the parties performed better.”</br>(emphasis supplied)</br>In the present case, the importance of the decoding registers was raised in the</br>examination of PW-41. Accordingly, the decoding registers merely being additional</br>documents required to be able to appreciate the existing evidence in form of the</br>call details which are already on record but use codes to signify the location of</br>accused, a crucial detail, which can be decoded only through the decoding</br>registers, the right of the accused to a fair trial is not prejudiced. The production of</br>the decoding registers fits into the requirement of being relevant material which</br>was not brought on record due to inadvertence.</br>41 Finally, we also briefly deal with the objection of the respondents regarding the</br>stage at which the application under Section 311 was filed. The respondents have</br>placed reliance on Swapan Kumar (supra), a two judge Bench decision of this</br>Court, to argue that the application should not be allowed as it has been made at a</br>belated stage. The Court in Swapan Kumar (supra) observed:</br>“11. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section 311 should be</br>invoked by the court only to meet the ends of justice. The power is to be exercised</br>only for strong and valid reasons and it should be exercised with great caution and</br>circumspection. The court has wide power under this Section to even recall</br>witnesses for re-examination or further examination, necessary in the interest of</br>justice, but the same has to be exercised after taking into consideration the facts</br>and circumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall not be</br>exercised if the court is of the view that the application has been filed as an abuse</br>of the process of law.</br>12. Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for</br>non-examination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the</br>witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not</br>be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive</br>applications for recall of a witness under this provision.”</br>In the present appeal, the argument that the application was filed after the closure</br>of the evidence of the prosecution is manifestly erroneous. As already noted</br>above, the closure of the evidence of the prosecution took place after the</br>application for the production of the decoding register and for summoning of the</br>witness under Section 311 was dismissed. Though the dismissal of the application</br>and the closure of the prosecution evidence both took place on 13 November 2021,</br>the application by the prosecution had been filed on 15 March 2021 nearly eight</br>months earlier. As a matter of fact, another witness for the prosecution, Rajesh</br>Kumar Singh, was also released after examination and cross-examination on the</br>same day as recorded in the order dated 13 November 2021 of the trial court.</br>42 \n",

       " in Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh (supra) while dealing with the prayers for</br>adducing additional evidence under Section 391 CrPC at the appellate stage, along</br>with a prayer for examination of witnesses under Section 311 CrPC explained the</br>role of the court, in the following terms:</br>“43. The courts have to take a participatory role in a trial. They are not expected</br>to be tape recorders to record whatever is being stated by the witnesses. Section</br>311 of the Code and Section 165 of the Evidence Act confer vast and wide powers</br>on presiding officers of court to elicit all necessary materials by playing an active</br>role in the evidence-collecting process. They have to monitor the proceedings</br>in aid of justice in a manner that something, which is not relevant, is not</br>unnecessarily brought into record. Even if the prosecutor is remiss in</br>some ways, it can control the proceedings effectively so that the ultimate</br>objective i.e. truth is arrived at. This becomes more necessary where the</br>court has reasons to believe that the prosecuting agency or the</br>prosecutor is not acting in the requisite manner. The court cannot afford</br>to be wishfully or pretend to be blissfully ignorant or oblivious to such</br>serious pitfalls or dereliction of duty on the part of the prosecuting</br>agency. The prosecutor who does not act fairly and acts more like a counsel for</br>the defence is a liability to the fair judicial system, and courts could not also play</br>into the hands of such prosecuting agency showing indifference or adopting an</br>attitude of total aloofness.”</br>(emphasis supplied)</br>Further, in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) (supra), \n",

The determinative factor is whether it is essential to the just</br>decision of the case. The section is not limited only for the benefit of the</br>accused, and it will not be an improper exercise of the powers of the court to</br>summon a witness under the section merely because the evidence supports the</br>case of the prosecution and not that of the accused.

       " while reiterating the principle enunciated in Mohanlal Shamji Soni</br>(supra) stressed upon the wide ambit of Section 311 which allows the power to be</br>exercised at any stage and held that:</br>“44. The power of the court under Section 165 of the Evidence Act is in a way</br>complementary to its power under Section 311 of the Code. The section consists of</br>two parts i.e.: (i) giving a discretion to the court to examine the witness at any</br>stage, and (ii) the mandatory portion which compels the court to examine a</br>witness if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the court.</br>Though the discretion given to the court is very wide, the very width requires a</br>corresponding caution. In Mohanlal v. Union of India this Court has observed, while</br>considering the scope and ambit of Section 311, that the very usage of the words</br>such as, “any court”, “at any stage”, or “any enquiry or trial or other proceedings”,</br>“any person” and “any such person” clearly spells out that the section has</br>expressed in the widest-possible terms and do not limit the discretion of the court</br>in any way. However, as noted above, the very width requires a corresponding</br>caution that the discretionary powers should be invoked as the exigencies of justice</br>require and exercised judicially with circumspection and consistently with the</br>provisions of the Code. The second part of the section does not allow any</br>discretion but obligates and binds the court to take necessary steps if the</br>fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case,</br>“essential” to an active and alert mind and not to one which is bent to</br>abandon or abdicate. Object of the section is to enable the court to arrive</br>at the truth irrespective of the fact that the prosecution or the defence</br>has failed to produce some evidence which is necessary for a just and proper</br>disposal of the case. The power is exercised and the evidence is examined neither</br>to help the prosecution nor the defence, if the court feels that there is necessity to</br>act in terms of Section 311 but only to subserve the cause of justice and public</br>interest. It is done with an object of getting the evidence in aid of a just decision</br>and to uphold the truth.</br>(emphasis supplied)</br>While reiterating the decisions of this Court in Karnel \n",
